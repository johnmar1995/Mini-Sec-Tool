## ⚙️ What It Does

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Process Recon & Termination**  
  List all running processes. Kill unwanted targets by PID or name.

- 🛡️ **Windows Defender Scan**  
  Quick or Full scans to root out malware and intruders.

- 🔌 **USB Drive Forensics**  
  Scan connected USB drives — no device gets past this.

- 💥 **Explorer.exe Control**  
  Terminate and resurrect the Windows shell on command.

- 🖥️ **Real-Time Interface**  
  Command-line menu with slick progress animations.

- 📜 **Audit Trail**  
  Logs saved to scan_log.txt — keep track of your ops.

---

## 🚨 Requirements

- Windows 10/11 with Windows Defender active  
- [.NET 6.0+ Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed  
- Administrator privileges for full scan and process control

---

## 🏃 How to Run

1. Fire up the program.  
2. Use the numeric menu to:  
   - Recon & kill processes  
   - Launch Defender scans (Quick / Full)  
   - Scan USB devices for threats  
   - Kill or restart explorer.exe  
   - Exit when mission’s complete

---

## ⚠️ Heads Up

- Scanning needs admin rights. Run as Administrator or get ready to face denied ops.  
- Killing explorer.exe will blow up your desktop shell — restart it from the menu or manually.  
- Logs are appended to scan_log.txt in the same folder — evidence never lies.
